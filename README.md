# Supermarket Sales Analysis  
This project involves analyzing a supermarket sales dataset to uncover actionable insights through **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**. The dataset contains records of sales transactions, customer demographics, and other key features. Insights gained from this analysis aim to assist supermarket management in making data-driven decisions.



## Dataset  
**Dataset Link:** [Supermarket Sales Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aungpyaeap/supermarket-sales)  

The dataset includes features such as sales transactions, payment methods, customer demographics, and ratings.



## Objectives  
- Identify high-performing branches.  
- Analyze customer preferences and spending behavior.  
- Study payment methods and their impact on sales.  
- Understand factors influencing sales and customer ratings.  



## Features of Analysis  
1. **Data Loading and Cleaning:**  
   - Imported dataset and inspected structure using Pandas methods (`.head()`, `.info()`, `.describe()`, `.shape()`).  
   - Checked and handled missing values, formatted columns, and removed duplicates.  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
   - Analyzed sales by:
     - Gender.  
     - Product category.  
     - Branch.  
     - Payment method.  
   - Examined relationships between key features like sales, ratings, and branches.  
   - Studied customer demographics and spending patterns.  

3. **Data Visualization:**  
   Visualized the data using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for better understanding:  
   - **Pie Chart:** Sales distribution by branch.  
   - **Bar Chart:** Payment methods vs. total sales.  
   - **Heatmap:** Correlation between numerical features.  
   - **Boxplot:** Sales distribution by customer gender.  

4. **Summary and Insights:**  
   - Highlighted revenue-generating branches.  
   - Determined the most popular payment method.  
   - Investigated gender influence on average sales amount.  



## Visualizations  
Key visualizations include:  
- **Sales Distribution by Branch**: (Pie chart).
